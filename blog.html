                  <strong>Map:  map() is used to create a new array from an existing array.</strong> It iterates through each element in the array and applies the provided function to each element and returns a new array. It doesn't alter the original array.<br>
                  <strong>Filter:  filter() is used to create a new array from an existing array by filtering out unwanted elements.</strong> It iterates through each element of the array and returns a new array with only the elements that pass the filter criteria.<br>
                  <strong>ForEach:  forEach() is used to iterate through an array and perform an action on each element.</strong> It does not return a new array, but instead applies a function to each element of the existing array.<br>
                  <strong>Find:  find() is used to find a single element in an array that matches a given criteria.</strong> It iterates through each element of the array and returns the first element that matches the given criteria.<br>

                  <strong>Local storage is the most recent mechanism.</strong> Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed.It allows 10MB of data to be stored.<br>
                  <strong>Session storage is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session.</strong> Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed.It allows 5MB of data to be stored.<br>
                  <strong>Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism.</strong> Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.The data can be set to expire at a certain time.The storage capacity is limited to 4KB of data.<br>

                    Event Loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. It has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback. It works by repeatedly 
                    checking for new events or inputs, and then processing them in order. The Event Loop is responsible for responding to user input, refreshing the display,and handling communication with other systems.

                    The quizTimer() function is used to keep track of the time a user takes to answer the quizzes. The function  also takes a dismiss argument, if it is set to true, will stop the counting. Initially, the color of the timer is green but when the value of the timer 
                    exceeds 60 seconds the color of the timer turns red.

                    The chooseQuiz() function takes an index and a given answer as arguments and updates the answers array for the selected quiz from the quizData array. It checks whether the quizzes answer already exists in the answers array and if it does, it replaces the 
                    existing answer with the given answer. If not, it adds the quizzes answer to the answers array. It also calls the displayAnswers function to display the updated answers array.
